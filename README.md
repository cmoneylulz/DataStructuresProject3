DataStructuresProject3
======================

An older homework project for datastructures at UWG. The assignment was to create a CLI adventure game in java that uses a graph datastructure to represent the game map. Players must navigate from room to room collecting objects to solve puzzles in order to unlock the treasure room and complete the game.

NOTE: this project may need to be updated with newer source code
